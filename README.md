# CycloHexLite
A Simple C++ command line version of CycloHex

CycloHex is a game like the boardgame Hex, but the edges of the board loop like PacMan. The goal is to connect from one tile across the board through your color's edge back to that same tile, making a cycle.

CycloHex is a game I made in Unity that can be played in a browser (https://aobatake1515.itch.io/cyclo-hex) or on Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1882950/CycloHex/). CycloHexLite is just a lightweight C++ port of the game that I'll be using to make a faster version of the AI.

This project is written entirely in C++ 14. It was made in Visual Studio on Windows, but it should compile and run on basically any machine.
